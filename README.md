Hello, I am GamingThief/Thief I have been in the FiveM Community for a while now and have been doing server development for half of it as well! this Server.cfg is what the CFG was back a while ago.
This is the most easy looking Config. and a lot of the info was "Fact Checked" via CFX's Docs 

CFX's Links for Fact Checks

https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server-vanilla/
https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/server-commands/

Most of the commented-out info (With the # (Hashtag) is commented out. easy way of knowing what is removable is anything with ">" at the end of it. some other comments can be but it isn't recommended if you have many owners
or if you think you will be turning off or on settings via CFG. Also, some things are controlled via TXADMIN but are commented out if that is the case. there is a note about this. 

If you delete the top two lines. help can be found via my server:
